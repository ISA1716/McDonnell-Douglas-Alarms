Half credit to him for the main addon, other half to me for the edit. To use these, get the Google Chrome Extention called Tampermonkey, click 'Create new script', and then paste the userscript.json code into the code box.
Will be updated if needed, if it doesn't work, please mention in the 'Issues' tab in the repository.
